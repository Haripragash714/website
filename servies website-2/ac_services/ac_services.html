        <!-- Service Card 1: AC Servicing -->
        <div class="service-card">
          <h3>1. AC Servicing (Jet & Foam Cleaning)</h3>
          <p>
            Our deep cleaning service uses a high-pressure jet and a specialized
            foam solution to thoroughly clean the indoor and outdoor units. This
            removes accumulated dust, dirt, and mold, leading to improved
            cooling efficiency, better airflow, and healthier air quality. The
            service includes a detailed inspection of the filters, coils, and
            drain line to ensure everything is functioning optimally. We also
            provide a final check of the unit's performance to ensure maximum
            comfort.

        <div class="service-card">
          <h3>2. Gas Top-Up</h3>
          <p>
            A gas top-up is essential when your AC's cooling performance
            decreases due to a refrigerant leak. Our technicians will first
            perform a comprehensive leak check using advanced tools to identify
            and fix any issues before refilling the refrigerant gas
            (R22/R32/R410A) for both split and window ACs. Post-service, we test
            the cooling performance to ensure your AC is running efficiently and
            your home is cool again.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Price:</strong> ₹1499 – ₹2199 (based on AC type)</p>

            or are extremely dirty. Our wet servicing provides a full, deep
            cleaning with water to remove stubborn dust, mold, and clogs that
            can significantly impact airflow and cooling. This service is
            especially effective for heavily contaminated units and is

            of mind.
